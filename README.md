# Request for Proposal (RFP) – Wireless Network Deployment

## 1. Introduction
This RFP is for selecting a vendor to help our office build a stable and secure wireless network. Our current Wi-Fi has weak-signal areas and sometimes disconnects, so we want a better system. The new wireless network should support modern standards, stronger security, and enough capacity for daily office use.
